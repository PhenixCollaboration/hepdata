    The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider measured the second Fourier component $v_{2}$ of the direct-photon azimuthal anisotropy at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. The results are presented in 10% wide bins of collision centrality and cover the transverse-momentum range of 1 < $p_T$ < 20 GeV/c, and are in quantitative agreement with findings published earlier, but provide better granularity and higher $p_T$ reach. Above a pT of 8–10 GeV/c, where hard scattering dominates the direct-photon production, $v_{2}$ is consistent with zero. Below that in each centrality bin $v_{2}$ as a function of $p_T$ is comparable to the $\pi^0$ anisotropy albeit with a tendency of being somewhat smaller. The results are compared to recent theory calculations that include, in addition to thermal radiation from the quark-gluon plasma and hadron gas, sources of photons from pre-equilibrium, strong magnetic fields, or radiative hadronization. While the newer theoretical calculations describe the data better than previous models, none of them alone can fully explain the results, particularly in the region of pT = 4–8 GeV/c.

Some data points were moved slightly in $p_{T}$ for clarity. The data is compared to previous measurements as well as to different theoretical models including pre-equilibrium contributions in the multimessenger model, modifications to such a scenario by the magnetic field present in the reaction volume, or radiative contributions at hadronization.
