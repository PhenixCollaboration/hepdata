comment: |
  PHENIX presents a simultaneous measurement of the production of direct $\gamma$ and $\pi^0$ in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV over a $p_T$ range of 7.5 to 18 GeV/c for different event samples selected by event activity, i.e. charged-particle multiplicity detected at forward rapidity. Direct-photon yields are used to empirically estimate the contribution of hard-scattering processes in the different event samples. Using this estimate, the average nuclear-modification factor $R^{\gamma^{dir}}_{dAu,EXP}$ is 0.925$\pm$0.023(stat)$\pm$0.15(scale), consistent with unity for minimum-bias (MB) d+Au events. For event classes with moderate event activity, $R^{\gamma^{dir}}_{dAu,EXP}$ is consistent with the MB value within 5% uncertainty. These results confirm that the previously observed enhancement of high-$p_T$ $\pi^0$ production found in small system collisions with low event activity is a result of a bias in interpreting event activity within the Glauber framework. In contrast, for the top 5% of events with the highest event activity, $R^{\gamma^{dir}}_{dAu,EXP}$ is suppressed by 20% relative to the MB value with a significance of 4.5$\sigma$, which may be due to final-state effects.
