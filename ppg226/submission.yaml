comment: "BNL-RHIC.  Reported here are transverse single-spin asymmetries ($A_N$) in the production of charged hadrons as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and Feynman-x ($x_F$) in polarized $p^{\\uparrow}+p$, $p^{\\uparrow}+$Al, and $p^{\\uparrow}+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. The measurements have been performed at forward and backward rapidity ($1.4<|\\eta| < 2.4$) over the range of $1.5 < p_T < 7.0 \\mathrm{\\ GeV}/c$ and $0.04 < |x_F| < 0.2$. A nonzero asymmetry is observed for positively charged hadrons at forward rapidity ($x_F > 0$) in $p^{\\uparrow}+p$ collisions, whereas the $p^{\\uparrow}+$Al and $p^{\\uparrow}+$Au results show smaller asymmetries. This finding provides new opportunities to investigate the origin of transverse single-spin asymmetries and a tool to study nuclear effects in $p+A$ collisions.\n"
