comment: BNL-RHIC.  We present the first measurements of the forward and midrapidity
 $\eta$ meson cross sections from $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV and $510$ GeV, 
 respectively. We also report the midrapidity $\eta/\pi^0$ ratio at 510 GeV. The forward 
 cross section is measured differentially in $\eta$ meson transverse momentum ($p_T$) from 
 1.0 to 6.5 GeV/c for pseudorapidity $3.0 < |\eta| < 3.8$. The midrapidity cross section 
 is measured from 3.5 to 44 GeV/c for pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 0.35$. Both cross sections 
 serve as critical inputs to an updated global analysis of the $\eta$ meson fragmentation functions
