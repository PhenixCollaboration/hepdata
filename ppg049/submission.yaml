comment: A measurement of direct photons in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$~GeV is presented. A photon excess above background from $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma+\gamma$, $\eta\rightarrow \gamma+\gamma$ and other decays is observed in the transverse momentum range $5.5 <p_\mathrm{T} < 7$~GeV/$c$. The result is compared to a next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculation.  Within errors, good agreement is found between the QCD calculation and the measured result.

description: <p>Measured cross section and NLO pQCD calculations for direct-photon production in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$200 GeV. The normalization error of 9.6% is not shown. The two data points plotted with an arrow indicate the beginning of the low- and high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ ranges where the direct photon signal is consistent with zero. The upper edges of the arrows indicate an upper limit (90% confidence level) for the direct photon cross section calculated from the statistical and systematic uncertainty.</p>
