  The jet cross section and jet-substructure observables in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV were measured by the PHENIX Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Jets are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks and electromagnetic-calorimeter clusters using the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with a jet radius $R=0.3$ for jets with transverse momentum within $8.0<p_T<40.0$ GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidity $|\eta|<0.15$.  Measurements include the jet cross section, as well as distributions of SoftDrop-groomed momentum fraction ($z_g$), charged-particle transverse momentum with respect to jet axis ($j_T$), and radial distributions of charged particles within jets ($r$).  Also measured was the distribution of $\xi=-ln(z)$, where $z$ is the fraction of the jet momentum carried by the charged particle. The measurements are compared to theoretical next-to and next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations, {\sc pythia} event generator, and to other existing experimental results. Indicated from these measurements is a lower particle multiplicity in jets at RHIC energies when compared to models.  Also noted are implications for future jet measurements with sPHENIX at RHIC as well as at the future Election-Ion Collider.
