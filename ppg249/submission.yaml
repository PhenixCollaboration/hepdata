  The PHENIX experiment has performed a systematic study of identified charged hadron ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, $\bar{p}$)  production at midrapidity in $p$+Al, $^3$He+Au, Cu+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and U+U collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. Identified charged hadron invariant transverse momentum ($p_T$) and transverse mass ($m_T$) spectra are presented and interpreted in terms of radially expanding thermalized system. The particle ratios of $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ have been measured in different centrality ranges of large (Cu+Au, U+U) and small ($p$+Al, $^3$He+Au) collision systems. The values of $K/\pi$ ratios measured in all considered collision systems were found to be consistent with those measured in $p$+$p$ collisions. However the values of $p/\pi$ ratios measured in large collision systems reach the values of $\sim0.6$, which is $\sim2$ times larger than in $p$+$p$ collisions. These results can be qualitatively understood in terms of the baryon enhancement expected from hadronization by recombination. Identified charged hadron nuclear modification factors ($R_{AB}$) are also presented. Enhancement of proton $R_{AB}$ values over meson $R_{AB}$ values was observed in central $^3$He+Au, Cu+Au, and U+U collisions. The proton $R_{AB}$ values measured in $p$+Al collision system were found to be consistent with $R_{AB}$ values of $\phi$, $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $\pi^0$ mesons, which may indicate that the size of the system produced in $p$+Al collisions is too small for recombination to cause a noticeable increase in proton production.
