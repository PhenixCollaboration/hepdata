  BNL-RHIC.  Yields for $J/\psi$ production in Cu$+$Cu collisions at $\sqrt(s_{NN)}= 200$ GeV have been measured by the PHENIX experiment over the rapidity range $|y| < 2.2$ at transverse momenta from 0 to beyond 5 GeV/c. The invariant yield is obtained as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum and collision centrality, and compared with results in p$+$p and Au$+$Au collisions at the same energy. The Cu$+$Cu data provide greatly improved precision over existing Au$+$Au data for $J/\psi$ production in collisions with small to intermediate numbers of participants, providing a key constraint that is needed for disentangling cold and hot nuclear matter effects.
