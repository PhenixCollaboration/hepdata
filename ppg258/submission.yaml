comment: BNL-RHIC.  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured low-mass vector-meson ($\omega+\rho$ and $\phi$) production through the dimuon decay channel at forward rapidity $(1.2 < |\mbox{y}| < 2.2)$ in $p$$+$$p$ and Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$~GeV. The low-mass vector-meson yield and nuclear modification factor were measured as a function of the average number of participating nucleons, $\langle N_{\rm part}\rangle$, and the transverse momentum $p_T$. These results were compared with those obtained via the kaon decay channel in a similar $p_T$ range at midrapidity. The nuclear modification factors in both rapidity regions are consistent within the uncertainties. A comparison of the $\omega+\rho$ and $J/\psi$ mesons reveals that the light and heavy flavors are consistently suppressed across both $p_T$ and $\langle N_{\rm part}\rangle$. In contrast,  the $\phi$ meson displays a nuclear modification factor consistent with unity, suggesting strangeness enhancement in the medium formed.
