  BNL-RHIC. Jet production rates are measured in $p$+$p$ and $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV recorded in 2008 with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Jets are reconstructed using the $R$ = 0.3 anti-$k_t$ algorithm from energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter and charged tracks in multi-wire proportional chambers, and the jet transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra are corrected for the detector response. Spectra are reported for jets with 12 < $p_T$ < 50 GeV/$c$, within a pseudorapidity acceptance of $∣\eta∣$ < 0.3. The nuclear-modification factor ($R_{dAu}$) values for 0%-100% $d$+Au events are found to be consistent with unity, constraining the role of initial state effects on jet production. However, the centrality-selected $R_{dAu}$ values and central-to-peripheral ratios ($R_{CP}$) show large, $p_T$-dependent deviations from unity, which challenge the conventional models that relate hard-process rates and soft-particle production in collisions involving nuclei.
